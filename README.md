# Sasta Wordle
### wordle if it was written by a moron<br>

Check out the website [here](im-nl.github.io/sasta-wordle/)

My first typescript project (compiled to js) 
I'm pretty sure I haven't been using typescript properly and if there are any corrections anyone would want to make you can [hit me up](https://aryansharma.tech). </a><br>

Make an issue if anyone has any suggestions on how to make it more efficient/ if there are any bad practices in the code; I'll try my best to fix everything :)
